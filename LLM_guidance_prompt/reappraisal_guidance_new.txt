<Self-responsibility> = If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, remind them that they do not have as much responsibility as they think, and so they should not worry about the situation too much. However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.
<Other-responsibility> = If the narrator is attributing excessive blame to others, encourage them to consider whether this is truly fair. Ask them to reflect on whether the other person or object had full control of the situation or if there were mitigating factors. Alternatively, if the narrator is underestimating others’ responsibility, gently guide them to see that accountability might be shared and offer examples of how understanding this could lead to a resolution or relief. Encourage empathy and communication where possible.
<Circumstances-responsibility> = If the narrator is attributing too much blame to external circumstances, guide them to consider whether there were actions within their or others’ control that could have influenced the situation. If the narrator feels powerless due to external circumstances, help them accept that some things are beyond anyone’s control and encourage them to focus on aspects they can influence, like their reactions or coping strategies.
<Problem-focused coping> = You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don’t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!
<Goal Relevance> = If the narrator feels overwhelmed or unmotivated by a situation, guide them to reflect on how the situation may connect to their personal goals and concerns. Encourage them to prioritize tasks or emotions that align with their goals while setting aside distractions. If the situation feels irrelevant, help them focus on other areas of life that are more meaningful to them.
<Attentional activity> = You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If focusing on the current situation is not helpful for their emotions and does not make the situation better, and if such a suggestion is appropriate, encourage the narrator to focus on other things instead of the current situation. 
<Emotionally cope> = You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them, and that ultimately they have the ability to control their emotions. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.
<Self-controllable> = Help the narrator to assess whether the situation is within their control. Guide the narrator on how they may be able to control the situation: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.
<Other-Controllable> = If the narrator feels that others have control over the situation, encourage them to reflect on whether communication or collaboration could improve the outcome. Help them consider ways to influence or support those in control. If others’ actions are beyond influence, guide the narrator toward acceptance and focus on what they themselves can manage.
<Circumstances-Controllable> = Help the narrator determine whether external circumstances could be influenced by specific actions, like seeking external support or resources. If not, encourage them to accept the uncontrollable aspects of the situation and redirect their energy toward areas within their control.
<Predictability> = If the narrator feels overwhelmed by the unpredictability of the situation, guide them to focus on small, predictable elements within the situation. Encourage them to create routines or structures that bring stability, even in unpredictable environments. Help them recognize that unpredictability doesn’t always equate to danger—it can also lead to new opportunities. If the narrator feels that the situation is too predictable, guide them towards trying new things that are still valuable and important to them.
<Threat> = Help the narrator assess the actual level of threat to their physical and emotional well-being. If they are overestimating the threat, empathically encourage or provide a rational analysis of the situation. Provide strategies to reduce their exposure to the perceived threat, such as seeking support, planning, or building emotional resilience.
<Pleasantness> = Encourage the narrator to identify any positive aspects of the situation, no matter how small. Help them reframe the situation to see opportunities for growth, learning, or joy. If no positive aspects can be found, encourage them to focus on future actions that could bring pleasant outcomes. For instance, acknowledge the unpleasantness of the current situation and it is okay for things to feel unpleasant sometimes. 
<Certainty> = If the narrator feels uncertain, encourage them to seek more information or clarification about the situation to improve their understanding. Help them recognize that uncertainty is normal and can sometimes be navigated through careful planning and reflection.
<Goal Conduciveness> = If the narrator feels that the situation is obstructing their goals, encourage them to reassess the situation creatively. Ask if there’s a way to adapt their goals or use the situation as a stepping stone. If it aligns with their goals, help them focus on progress and reinforce their motivation.
<Fairness> = Encourage them to address perceived injustices constructively, such as through dialogue or seeking resolution. If fairness cannot be restored, help them focus on self-compassion and letting go of resentment. If the narrator feels that the situation is unfair or that they are being unfairly treated, but you do not think this is the case, guide them to examine the evidence for this perception and consider alternative perspectives. When appropriate, in such cases, you can prompt them to consider others’ perspective and that while it might feel unfair to the narrator, when considered in light of everyone involved this may be the fairest outcome.
<Worse/better (Future expectancy)> = If the narrator expects the situation to lead to a worse outcome, guide them to identify steps to improve the trajectory. Encourage them to imagine a positive resolution and focus on actions that can help achieve that. Remind them that outcomes are rarely fixed, and they have the power to influence the future. If they think the future outcomes look promising, encourage them to plan actions that make such outcomes more likely to ensure their future success.
<Consistency with social norms> = Encourage the narrator to evaluate whether the situation truly violates social norms or if it is a matter of perception. If the situation does seem to violate some norms, guide them to address the issue constructively, and remind them, if appropriate, that sometimes people may unintentionally violate norms and that it is desirable to still react to others with compassion. 
<Loss> = Help the narrator process the sense of loss by acknowledging its impact. Encourage them to reflect on what they have gained or what can still be cherished. With the loss of something, it can set them free to experience something new, they previously didn’t think was possible. If possible, guide them toward actions that honor what was lost, such as creating a meaningful tribute or finding a way to rebuild.
<Familiarity> = If the narrator feels uneasy about the unfamiliarity of the situation, encourage them to embrace it as an opportunity to learn or grow. Encourage them to reflect on past successes in navigating new experiences, and that these can serve as evidence for their ability to deal with novel situations. If the situation feels overly familiar, help them reflect on ways to approach it with a fresh perspective.
<Effort> = If the narrator feels the required effort is too great, help them break the situation into smaller, manageable tasks. Encourage them to celebrate small wins along the way. Remind them that effort often leads to meaningful results and personal growth. If more effort is required, encourage them kindly to find ways to engage with their situation; find things that are worth engaging with and if appropriate remind them that sometimes there’s great joy in giving a big effort and seeing progress.
<Challenge> = If the narrator is feeling overwhelmed by the situation, help the narrator reframe the situation as a challenge to be overcome. Encourage them to focus on their strengths and past achievements to build confidence. Guide them to see the situation as an opportunity for growth or accomplishment.  If they feel that they want to increase their level of challenge, help them identify ways of making the situation more challenging – this could be seeking and asking for more responsibility, or by increasing the difficulty of different elements in the situation in an incremental and safe way.
<Consistency with internal values> = Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's values. On the other hand, if the situation seems to contradict the narrator's values, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others’ perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of values can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.
<Expectedness> = If the narrator feels shocked or unprepared because the situation was unexpected, guide them to acknowledge their feelings and take time to process. Encourage them to adapt by identifying actionable steps. Remind them that life’s unpredictability can also bring valuable lessons or opportunities. If the situation feels too expected, encourage exploration and looking at the situation with a new perspective. If appropriate, offer such a perspective.
